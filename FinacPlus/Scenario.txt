-->How will I use this metadata?

Search Optimization: When a user searches for “casual shirts,” the system will filter and return shirts
                     that match based on keywords like “Casual” and “Shirt” from the tags.
Personalized Recommendations: If a customer has purchased other items in the Clothing category, 
                            I could recommend this shirt based on their browsing or purchase history.
Pricing and Discounts: Use the price and any discounts to apply special offers or adjust prices dynamically.

Product Display: Display product details like size, color, description, and images on the product page
                      to help customers make informed buying decisions.
Ratings & Reviews: Analyze reviews to display product feedback and assist other customers in their purchase decisions.

Shipping & Delivery: Use shipping information to calculate delivery times and shipping fees at checkout.
